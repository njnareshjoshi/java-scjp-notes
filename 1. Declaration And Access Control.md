## Identifiers
- Identifiers can begin with a letter, an underscore, or a currency character.
- After the first character, identifiers can also include digits.
- Identifiers can be of any length.
- JavaBeans methods must be named using camelCase, and depending on the method's purpose, must start with set, get, is, add, or remove

## Declaration Rules
- A source code file can have only one public class.
- If the source file contains a public class, the filename must match the public class name.
- A file can have only one package statement, but multiple imports.
- The package statement (if any) must be the first (non-comment) line in a source file.
- The import statements (if any) must come after the package and before the class declaration.
- If there is no package statement, import statements must be the first (noncomment) statements in the source file.
- package and import statements apply to all classes in the file.
- A file can have more than one nonpublic class.
- Files with no public classes have no naming restrictions

## Class Access Modifiers
- There are three access modifiers: public, protected, and private.
- There are four access levels: public, protected, default, and private.
- Classes can have only public or default access.
- A class with default access can be seen only by classes within the same package.
- A class with public access can be seen by all classes from all packages.
- Class visibility revolves around whether code in one class can
  - Create an instance of another class
  - Extend (or subclass), another class
  - Access methods and variables of another class.


## Class Modifiers (Nonaccess)
- Classes can also be modified with final, abstract, or strictfp.
- A class cannot be both final and abstract.
- A final class cannot be subclassed.
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
- A single abstract method in a class means the whole class must be abstract.
- An abstract class can have both abstract and nonabstract methods.
- The first concrete class to extend an abstract class must implement all of its abstract methods

## Interface Implementation
- Interfaces are contracts for what a class can do, but they say nothing about the way in which the class must do it.
- Interfaces can be implemented by any class, from any inheritance tree.
- An interface is like a 100-percent abstract class, and is implicitly abstract whether you type the abstract modifier in the declaration or not.
- An interface can have only abstract methods, no concrete methods allowed.
- Interface methods are by default public and abstract—explicit declaration of these modifiers is optional.
- Interfaces can have constants, which are always implicitly public, static, and final.
- Interface constant declarations of public, static, and final are optional in any combination.
- A legal nonabstract implementing class has the following properties:
  - It provides concrete implementations for the interface's methods.
  - It must follow all legal override rules for the methods it implements.
  - It must not declare any new checked exceptions for an implementation method.
  - It must not declare any checked exceptions that are broader than the exceptions declared in the interface method.
  - It may declare runtime exceptions on any interface method implementation regardless of the interface declaration.
  - It must maintain the exact signature (allowing for covariant returns) and return type of the methods it implements (but does not have to declare the exceptions of the interface).
- A class implementing an interface can itself be abstract.
- An abstract implementing class does not have to implement the interface methods (but the first concrete subclass must).
- A class can extend only one class (no multiple inheritance), but it can implement many interfaces.
- Interfaces can extend one or more other interfaces.
- Interfaces cannot extend a class, or implement a class or interface.
- When taking the exam, verify that interface and class declarations are legal before verifying other code logic

## Member Access Modifiers
- Methods and instance (nonlocal) variables are known as "members."
- Members can use all four access levels: public, protected, default, private.
- Member access comes in two forms:
  - Code in one class can access a member of another class.
  - A subclass can inherit a member of its superclass.
- If a class cannot be accessed, its members cannot be accessed.
- Determine class visibility before determining member visibility.
- public members can be accessed by all other classes, even in other packages.
- If a superclass member is public, the subclass inherits it—regardless of package.
- Members accessed without the dot operator (.) must belong to the same class.
- this. always refers to the currently executing object.
- this.aMethod() is the same as just invoking aMethod().
- private members can be accessed only by code in the same class.
- private members are not visible to subclasses, so private members cannot be inherited.
- Default and protected members differ only when subclasses are involved:
  - Default members can be accessed only by classes in the same package.
  - protected members can be accessed by other classes in the same package, plus subclasses regardless of package.
  - protected = package plus kids (kids meaning subclasses).
  - For subclasses outside the package, the protected member can be accessed only through inheritance; a subclass outside the package cannot access a protected member by using a reference to a superclass instance (in other words, inheritance is the only mechanism for a subclass outside the package to access a protected member of its superclass).
  - A protected member inherited by a subclass from another package is not accessible to any other class in the subclass package, except for the subclass' own subclasses

## Local Variables
- Local (method, automatic, or stack) variable declarations cannot have access modifiers.
- final is the only modifier available to local variables.
- Local variables don't get default values, so they must be initialized before use

## Other Modifiers—Members
- final methods cannot be overridden in a subclass.
- abstract methods are declared, with a signature, a return type, and an optional throws clause, but are not implemented.
- abstract methods end in a semicolon—no curly braces.
- Three ways to spot a non-abstract method:
  - The method is not marked abstract.
  - The method has curly braces.
  - The method has code between the curly braces.
- The first nonabstract (concrete) class to extend an abstract class must implement all of the abstract class' abstract methods.
- The synchronized modifier applies only to methods and code blocks.
- synchronized methods can have any access control and can also be marked final.
- abstract methods must be implemented by a subclass, so they must be inheritable. For that reason:
  - abstract methods cannot be private.
  - abstract methods cannot be final.
- The native modifier applies only to methods.
- The strictfp modifier applies only to classes and methods

## Methods with var-args
- As of Java 5, methods can declare a parameter that accepts from zero to many arguments, a so-called var-arg method.
- A var-arg parameter is declared with the syntax type... name; for instance: doStuff(int... x) { }
- A var-arg method can have only one var-arg parameter.
- In methods with normal parameters and a var-arg, the var-arg must come last

## Variable Declarations
- Instance variables can
  - Have any access control
  - Be marked final or transient
- Instance variables can't be abstract, synchronized, native, or strictfp.
- It is legal to declare a local variable with the same name as an instance variable; this is called "shadowing."
- final variables have the following properties:
  - final variables cannot be reinitialized once assigned a value.
  - final reference variables cannot refer to a different object once the object has been assigned to the final variable.
  - final reference variables must be initialized before the constructor completes.
- There is no such thing as a final object. An object reference marked final does not mean the object itself is immutable.
- The transient modifier applies only to instance variables.
- The volatile modifier applies only to instance variables

## Array Declarations
- Arrays can hold primitives or objects, but the array itself is always an object.
- When you declare an array, the brackets can be to the left or right of the variable name.
- It is never legal to include the size of an array in the declaration.
- An array of objects can hold any object that passes the IS-A (or instanceof) test for the declared type of the array. For example, if Horse extends Animal, then a Horse object can go into an Animal array.

## Static Variables and Methods
- They are not tied to any particular instance of a class.
- No classes instances are needed in order to use static members of the class.
- There is only one copy of a static variable / class and all instances share it.
- static methods do not have direct access to non-static members

## Enums
- An enum specifies a list of constant values assigned to a type.
- An enum is NOT a String or an int; an enum constant's type is the enum type. For example, SUMMER and FALL are of the enum type Season.
- An enum can be declared outside or inside a class, but NOT in a method.
- An enum declared outside a class must NOT be marked static, final, abstract, protected, or private.
- Enums can contain constructors, methods, variables, and constant class bodies.
- enum constants can send arguments to the enum constructor, using the syntax BIG(8), where the int literal 8 is passed to the enum constructor.
- enum constructors can have arguments, and can be overloaded.
- enum constructors can NEVER be invoked directly in code. They are always called automatically when an enum is initialized.
- The semicolon at the end of an enum declaration is optional. These are legal: enum Foo { ONE, TWO, THREE} enum Foo { ONE, TWO, THREE};
- MyEnum.values() returns an array of MyEnum's values.
