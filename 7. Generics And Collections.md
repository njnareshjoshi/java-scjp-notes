## Overriding hashCode() and equals()
- equals(), hashCode(), and toString() are public.
- Override toString() so that System.out.println() or other methods can see something useful, like your object's state.
- Use == to determine if two reference variables refer to the same object.
- Use equals() to determine if two objects are meaningfully equivalent.
- If you don't override equals(), your objects won't be useful hashing keys.
- If you don't override equals(), different objects can't be considered equal.
- Strings and wrappers override equals() and make good hashing keys.
- When overriding equals(), use the instanceof operator to be sure you're evaluating an appropriate class.
- When overriding equals(), compare the objects' significant attributes.
- Highlights of the equals() contract:
  - Reflexive: x.equals(x) is true.
  - Symmetric: If x.equals(y) is true, then y.equals(x) must be true.
  - Transitive: If x.equals(y) is true, and y.equals(z) is true, then z.equals(x) is true.
  - Consistent: Multiple calls to x.equals(y) will return the same result.
  - Null: If x is not null, then x.equals(null) is false.
- If x.equals(y) is true, then x.hashCode() == y.hashCode() is true.
- If you override equals(), override hashCode().
- HashMap, HashSet, Hashtable, LinkedHashMap, & LinkedHashSet use hashing.
- An appropriate hashCode() override sticks to the hashCode() contract.
- An efficient hashCode() override distributes keys evenly across its buckets.
- An overridden equals() must be at least as precise as its hashCode() mate.
- To reiterate: if two objects are equal, their hashcodes must be equal.
- It's legal for a hashCode() method to return the same value for all instances (although in practice it's very inefficient). Two-Minute Drill 631 ✓ 632 Chapter 7: Generics and Collections
- Highlights of the hashCode() contract:
  - Consistent: multiple calls to x.hashCode() return the same integer.
  - If x.equals(y) is true, x.hashCode() == y.hashCode() is true.
  - If x.equals(y) is false, then x.hashCode() == y.hashCode() can be either true or false, but false will tend to create better efficiency.
- transient variables aren't appropriate for equals() and hashCode()

## Collections
- Common collection activities include adding objects, removing objects, verifying object inclusion, retrieving objects, and iterating.
- Three meanings for "collection":
  - collection Represents the data structure in which objects are stored
  - Collection java.util interface from which Set and List extend
  - Collections A class that holds static collection utility methods
- Four basic flavors of collections include Lists, Sets, Maps, Queues:
  - Lists of things Ordered, duplicates allowed, with an index.
  - Sets of things May or may not be ordered and/or sorted; duplicates not allowed.
  - Maps of things with keys May or may not be ordered and/or sorted; duplicate keys are not allowed.
  - Queues of things to process Ordered by FIFO or by priority.
- Four basic sub-flavors of collections Sorted, Unsorted, Ordered, Unordered.
  - Ordered Iterating through a collection in a specific, non-random order.
  - Sorted Iterating through a collection in a sorted order.
- Sorting can be alphabetic, numeric, or programmer-defined

## Key Attributes of Common Collection Classes
- ArrayList: Fast iteration and fast random access.
- Vector: It's like a slower ArrayList, but it has synchronized methods.
- LinkedList: Good for adding elements to the ends, i.e., stacks and queues.
- HashSet: Fast access, assures no duplicates, provides no ordering.
- LinkedHashSet: No duplicates; iterates by insertion order.
- TreeSet: No duplicates; iterates in sorted order.
- HashMap: Fastest updates (key/values); allows one null key, many null values.
- Hashtable: Like a slower HashMap (as with Vector, due to its synchronized methods). No null values or null keys allowed.
- LinkedHashMap: Faster iterations; iterates by insertion order or last accessed; allows one null key, many null values.
- TreeMap: A sorted map.
- PriorityQueue: A to-do list ordered by the elements' priority

## Using Collection Classes
- Collections hold only Objects, but primitives can be autoboxed.
- Iterate with the enhanced for, or with an Iterator via hasNext() & next().
- hasNext() determines if more elements exist; the Iterator does NOT move.
- next() returns the next element AND moves the Iterator forward.
- To work correctly, a Map's keys must override equals() and hashCode().
- Queues use offer() to add an element, poll() to remove the head of the queue, and peek() to look at the head of a queue.
- As of Java 6 TreeSets and TreeMaps have new navigation methods like floor() and higher().
- You can create/extend "backed" sub-copies of TreeSets and TreeMaps

## Sorting and Searching Arrays and Lists
- Sorting can be in natural order, or via a Comparable or many Comparators.
- Implement Comparable using compareTo(); provides only one sort order.
- Create many Comparators to sort a class many ways; implement compare().
- To be sorted and searched, a List's elements must be comparable.
- To be searched, an array or List must first be sorted

## Utility Classes: Collections and Arrays
- Both of these java.util classes provide
  - A sort() method. Sort using a Comparator or sort using natural order.
  - A binarySearch() method. Search a pre-sorted array or List.
- Arrays.asList() creates a List from an array and links them together.
- Collections.reverse() reverses the order of elements in a List.
- Collections.reverseOrder() returns a Comparator that sorts in reverse.
- Lists and Sets have a toArray() method to create arrays

## Generics
- Generics let you enforce compile-time type safety on Collections (or other classes and methods declared using generic type parameters).
- An ArrayList can accept references of type Dog, Cat, or any other subtype of Animal (subclass, or if Animal is an interface, implementation).
- When using generic collections, a cast is not needed to get (declared type) elements out of the collection. With non-generic collections, a cast is required: List gList = new ArrayList(); List list = new ArrayList(); // more code String s = gList.get(0); // no cast needed String s = (String)list.get(0); // cast required
- You can pass a generic collection into a method that takes a non-generic collection, but the results may be disastrous. The compiler can't stop the method from inserting the wrong type into the previously type safe collection.
- If the compiler can recognize that non-type-safe code is potentially endangering something you originally declared as type-safe, you will get a compiler warning. For instance, if you pass a List into a method declared as void foo(List aList) { aList.add(anInteger); } You'll get a warning because add() is potentially "unsafe".
- "Compiles without error" is not the same as "compiles without warnings." A compilation warning is not considered a compilation error or failure.
- Generic type information does not exist at runtime—it is for compile-time safety only. Mixing generics with legacy code can create compiled code that may throw an exception at runtime.
- Polymorphic assignments applies only to the base type, not the generic type parameter. You can say List aList = new ArrayList(); // yes You can't say List aList = new ArrayList(); // no
- The polymorphic assignment rule applies everywhere an assignment can be made. The following are NOT allowed: void foo(List aList) { } // cannot take a List List bar() { } // cannot return a List
- Wildcard syntax allows a generic method, accept subtypes (or supertypes) of the declared type of the method argument: void addD(List d) {} // can take only  void addD(List) {} // take a  or
- The wildcard keyword extends is used to mean either "extends" or "implements." So in , Dog can be a class or an interface.
- When using a wildcard, List, the collection can be accessed but not modified.
- When using a wildcard, List, any generic type can be assigned to the reference, but for access only, no modifications.
- List refers only to a List, while List or List can hold any type of object, but for access only.
- Declaration conventions for generics use T for type and E for element: public interface List // API declaration for List boolean add(E o) // List.add() declaration
- The generics type identifier can be used in class, method, and variable declarations: class Foo { } // a class T anInstance; // an instance variable Foo(T aRef) {} // a constructor argument void bar(T aRef) {} // a method argument T baz() {} // a return type The compiler will substitute the actual type.
- You can use more than one parameterized type in a declaration: public class UseTwo { }
- You can declare a generic method using a type not defined in the class: public  void makeList(T t) { } is NOT using T as the return type. This method has a void return type, but to use T within the method's argument you must declare the , which happens before the return type.
