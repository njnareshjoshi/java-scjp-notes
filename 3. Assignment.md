## Stack and Heap
- Local variables (method variables) live on the stack.
- Objects and their instance variables live on the heap

## Literals and Primitive Casting
- Integer literals can be decimal, octal (e.g. 013), or hexadecimal (e.g. 0x3d).
- Literals for longs end in L or l.
- Float literals end in F or f, double literals end in a digit or D or d.
- The boolean literals are true and false.
- Literals for chars are a single character inside single quotes: 'd'

## Scope
- Scope refers to the lifetime of a variable.
- There are four basic scopes:
  - Static variables live basically as long as their class lives.
  - Instance variables live as long as their object lives.
  - Local variables live as long as their method is on the stack; however, if their method invokes another method, they are temporarily unavailable.
  - Block variables (e.g., in a for or an if) live until the block completes

## Basic Assignments
- Literal integers are implicitly ints.
- Integer expressions always result in an int-sized result, never smaller.
- Floating-point numbers are implicitly doubles (64 bits).
- Narrowing a primitive truncates the high order bits.
- Compound assignments (e.g. +=), perform an automatic cast.
- A reference variable holds the bits that are used to refer to an object.
- Reference variables can refer to subclasses of the declared type but not to superclasses.
- When creating a new object, e.g., Button b = new Button();, three things happen:
  - Make a reference variable named b, of type Button
  - Create a new Button object
  - Assign the Button object to the reference variable b

## Using a Variable or Array Element That Is Uninitialized and Unassigned
- When an array of objects is instantiated, objects within the array are not instantiated automatically, but all the references get the default value of null.
- When an array of primitives is instantiated, elements get default values.
- Instance variables are always initialized with a default value.
- Local/automatic/method variables are never given a default value. If you attempt to use one before initializing it, you'll get a compiler error.

## Passing Variables into Methods
- Methods can take primitives and/or object references as arguments.
- Method arguments are always copies.
- Method arguments are never actual objects (they can be references to objects).
- A primitive argument is an unattached copy of the original primitive.
- A reference argument is another copy of a reference to the original object.
- Shadowing occurs when two variables with different scopes share the same name. This leads to hard-to-find bugs, and hard-to-answer exam questions. Array Declaration, Construction, and Initialization (Obj. 1.3)
- Arrays can hold primitives or objects, but the array itself is always an object.
- When you declare an array, the brackets can be left or right of the name.
- It is never legal to include the size of an array in the declaration.
- You must include the size of an array when you construct it (using new) unless you are creating an anonymous array.
- Elements in an array of objects are not automatically created, although primitive array elements are given default values.
- You'll get a NullPointerException if you try to use an array element in an object array, if that element does not refer to a real object.
- Arrays are indexed beginning with zero.
- An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs if you use a bad index value.
- Arrays have a length variable whose value is the number of array elements.
- The last index you can access is always one less than the length of the array.
- Multidimensional arrays are just arrays of arrays.
- The dimensions in a multidimensional array can have different lengths.
- An array of primitives can accept any value that can be promoted implicitly to the array's declared type;. e.g., a byte variable can go in an int array.
- An array of objects can hold any object that passes the IS-A (or instanceof) test for the declared type of the array. For example, if Horse extends Animal, then a Horse object can go into an Animal array.
- If you assign an array to a previously declared array reference, the array you're assigning must be the same dimension as the reference you're assigning it to.
- You can assign an array of one type to a previously declared array reference of one of its supertypes. For example, a Honda array can be assigned to an array declared as type Car (assuming Honda extends Car).

## Initialization Blocks
- Static initialization blocks run once, when the class is first loaded.
- Instance initialization blocks run every time a new instance is created. They run after all super-constructors and before the constructor's code has run.
- If multiple init blocks exist in a class, they follow the rules stated above, AND they run in the order in which they appear in the source file

## Using Wrappers
- The wrapper classes correlate to the primitive types.
- Wrappers have two main functions:
  - To wrap primitives so that they can be handled like objects
  - To provide utility methods for primitives (usually conversions)
- The three most important method families are
  - xxxValue() Takes no arguments, returns a primitive
  - parseXxx() Takes a String, returns a primitive, throws NFE
  - valueOf() Takes a String, returns a wrapped object, throws NFE
- Wrapper constructors can take a String or a primitive, except for Character, which can only take a char.
- Radix refers to bases (typically) other than 10; octal is radix = 8, hex = 16

## Boxing
- As of Java 5, boxing allows you to convert primitives to wrappers or to convert wrappers to primitives automatically.
- Using == with wrappers created through boxing is tricky; those with the same small values (typically lower than 127), will be ==, larger values will not be ==

## Advanced Overloading
- Primitive widening uses the "smallest" method argument possible.
- Used individually, boxing and var-args are compatible with overloading.
- You CANNOT widen from one wrapper type to another. (IS-A fails.)
- You CANNOT widen and then box. (An int can't become a Long.)
- You can box and then widen. (An int can become an Object, via an Integer.)
- You can combine var-args with either widening or boxing

## Garbage Collection
- In Java, garbage collection (GC) provides automated memory management.
- The purpose of GC is to delete objects that can't be reached.
- Only the JVM decides when to run the GC, you can only suggest it.
- You can't know the GC algorithm for sure.
- Objects must be considered eligible before they can be garbage collected.
- An object is eligible when no live thread can reach it.
- To reach an object, you must have a live, reachable reference to that object.
- Java applications can run out of memory.
- Islands of objects can be GCed, even though they refer to each other.
- Request garbage collection with System.gc(); (only before the SCJP 6).
- Class Object has a finalize() method.
- The finalize() method is guaranteed to run once and only once before the garbage collector deletes an object.
- The garbage collector makes no guarantees, finalize() may never run.
- You can uneligibilize an object for GC from within finalize().
